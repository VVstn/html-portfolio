<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! My name is Weston and I am a recent graduate of Nucamp's software development bootcamp. 
I am excited to begin my career as a Software Engineer and am eager to apply the skills and knowledge I gained during my bootcamp experience.</p>
<p>During my time at Nucamp, I learned the fundamentals of web development, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and React Native.
I also gained experience working with databases and APIs, and learned how to build full-stack web applications.</p>  
<p>In addition to my technical skills, I am a quick learner and a team player. I enjoy collaborating with others to solve problems and am always looking for ways to improve my skills and knowledge.</p>
<p>I am currently seeking a Software Engineer position where I can continue to learn and grow as a developer. Thank you for considering my application, and I look forward to the opportunity to contribute to your team.</p>
